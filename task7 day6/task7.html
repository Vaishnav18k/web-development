            Human brains use water and dissolved salt particles called ions as their medium, while advanced computer systems rely on conventional solid materials for the same function. With the recent breakthrough, it has become clear that computers can be developed that will work like a human brain.</p>

            According to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists have a device called an Iontronic memristor, which carries water and salt inside. It measures just 150 by 200 micrometers wide, the same width as three or four human hairs put side-by-side.</p>

        <div class="border-red">An artificial brain is a complete set of software and hardware with cognitive abilities similar to those of the animal or human brain. Neuroscientists across the world are trying to understand how the human brain works, known as cognitive neuroscience. They are also attempting on thought experiments, demonstrating that it is possible, at least in theory, to create a machine that has all the capabilities of a human being.
            Scientists are also working on a long-term project to create machine

        This device also remembers how much electrical charge has previously flowed through it. Like human brains, these electrical impulses cause ions to move through the cone-shaped channel, with variations in the electrical charge leading to variations in the ion movement.
